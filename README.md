This project involves analyzing a dataset on food balance sheets in East Africa to answer questions on production, consumption, imports, and correlation over various years (2014-2018). Key tasks include:

Dataset Loading: The dataset is loaded with encoding adjustment to handle non-UTF-8 characters.
Data Analysis:
Calculation of the total animal fat produced in 2014 and 2017.
Mean and standard deviation for 2015 data.
Missing data analysis for 2016.
Identifying correlations with 'Element Code' and determining which year had the highest import quantity.
Summation tasks on production, and finding elements with highest/lowest sums in 2018.
Country Analysis: Import quantities for specific countries (e.g., Algeria in 2018) and identifying the total number of unique countries in the dataset.
This analysis provides insights into food production, supply, and import patterns across East African countries, leveraging pandas for data manipulation and aggregation.
